Exploit Loader for the Sony PS Vita

========================================================
How to install/run on the Vita
========================================================

1) Extract this archive in your CMA PSP Savedata folder. It is a folder on your PC named PSSAVEDATA/[lots of random characters here]. If you don't know where it is, check your settings in CMA

2) Connect your PS Vita to the PC through the CMA, it should give you the possibility to copy the savedata from your PC to the Vita. If not, you probably extracted it in the wrong folder.

3) To trigger the exploit, start game and load the exploited savegame then talk with the red-haired girl "Liliana" and select sell and "sell" the exploited item. At this point, the Hello World should start.

Informations about the Exploit
========================================================

Sadly the Exploit is pretty useless, so it can't run the VHBL that makes impossible to load any Homebrews, you can only execute small code applications like User Memory Dumper or something other like this.
